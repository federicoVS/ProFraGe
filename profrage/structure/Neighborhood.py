class Neighborhood:
    """
    Model a neighborhood.
    
    A neighborhood is defined as a centroid along with k subsequent residues on the left and on the right,
    thus creating a neighborhood of 2k+1 residues.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    idx : int
        The ID of the neighborhood.
    residues : list of Bio.PDB.Residue
        The list of residues composing the neighborhood.
    max_inters : int
        The maximum number of interacting neighborhoods to be considered when creating a fragment out
        of the neighborhood. The interactions are selected based on their score, thus keeping the best
        `max_inters`.
    features : numpy.ndarray
        The features representing the subset of residues.
    interactions : list of (fragments.data.Neighborhood, float)
        The list of interactions. Each entry is a tuple, the first element being the interacting
        neighborhood, and the second being the interaction score.

        Parameters
        ----------
        idx : int

        residues : list of Bio.PDB.Residue
            The list of residues composing the neighborhood.
        max_inters : int, optional
            The maximum number of interacting neighborhoods. The default is 1.
