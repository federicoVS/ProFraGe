class LanguageModel:
    """
    Implement a language model where protein fragments act as words.
    
    The frequencies for each word extracted from a training set is counted and compared to those of
    the testing set.
    
    The training and testing set are represented with clusters. All elements of a single cluster
    represent single words. This is because no two fragments are exactly equal, so clustering is introduced
    based on QCPSimilarity.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    sentence_probs : dict of str -> float in [0,1]
        The probability that a protein is made of its fragments. The mapping is based on the PDB ID of
        single proteins.
    word_probs : dict of str -> float in [0,1]
        The probabilities of single words. These are based on the training set. The mapping is based on the
        PDB ID of fragments.
    words : list of (Bio.PDB.Structure, int)
            A list of words, where each word is a tuple holding a structure and the number of times it
            appears.
    rmsd_thr : float
        The RMSD score threshold below which two words (fragments) are considered to be similar.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, words, rmsd_thr):
        """
        Initialize the class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        words : list of (Bio.PDB.Structure, int)
            A list of words, where each word is a tuple holding the structure and the number of times it appears in the dataset.
        rmsd_thr : float
            The RMSD score threshold. The lower, the tighter.

        None.

        ----------
        pdb_id : str
            The PDB ID of the protein the fragments belong to.
        fragments : list of Bio.PDB.Structure
            The list of structures. Note that the fragments should be filtered but not further clustered.
