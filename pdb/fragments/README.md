## Fragments

This directory will contain the mined fragments from the proteins. Given a fragment mining method `m`, three subdirectories will be created: `m/`, where all the mined fragments will be stored, 'm-filtered/', where the filtered fragments will be stored, and `m-clustered`, where the clustered fragments will be stored.
